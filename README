 This example demonstrates a very simple application where an energy
 deposit is accounted in user actions and their associated objects
 and a dose in a selected volume is calculated. 

	
 1- Build
    To build this application, create a build directly and execute cmake using the CMakeList.txt file. Ensure you have all the packages needed.
    After this, it is just compiling the executable.

 2- HOW TO RUN

    - Execute exampleB1 in the 'interactive mode' with visualization:
        % ./exampleB1
      and type in the commands from run1.mac line by line:  
        Idle> /control/verbose 2
        Idle> /tracking/verbose 1
        Idle> /run/beamOn 10 
        Idle> ...
        Idle> exit
      or
        Idle> /control/execute run1.mac
        ....
        Idle> exit

    - Execute exampleB1  in the 'batch' mode from macro files 
      (without visualization)
        % ./exampleB1 config.json
        The JSON file include some input parameters including the macro files.
